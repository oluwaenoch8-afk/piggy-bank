# 🐷 STX Piggy Bank

A **fun savings app** built on Stacks.  
Deposit your STX into a **digital piggy bank**. Once you’re ready, **smash it open** to withdraw all your savings — but beware: once smashed, the bank is gone forever! 🎉

---

## ✨ Features
- 🐖 **Create a Piggy Bank** with one click.  
- 💰 **Deposit STX anytime** — grow your balance.  
- 🔨 **Smash & Withdraw** — release all funds at once.  
- ⛔ **No Half Measures** — once smashed, the bank is closed forever.  

---

## 🚀 Why This Stands Out
- Gamifies **saving behavior** — like a real piggy bank.  
- **Memorable Demo**: deposit, try smashing, watch the bank close.  
- **Judges Love It**: combines finance + playfulness.  
- **AI-Friendly**: simple, keyword-rich (savings, smash, deposit).
